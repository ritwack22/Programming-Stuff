Variables
Variables are names attached to a particular object
You assign a value using the (=) operator
eg. n=300 - n is assigned the value 300

You can also perform chained Assignment
eg. a=b=c=10    

Object Reference
A python variable is a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object. 
Once the oject is assigned a variable you can call it using its name but the value still exists in the object itself. 
eg. n=300, n points to object 300
m=n, both m and n now points to object 300

Object Identity
Every object that is created has a number that uniquely identifies it.
No 2 object will ever have the same id
Python function id() gives the current identifier of the variable

Variable names
Can be any length
Consist of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, underscore
First character cannot be a digit
Using snake case (_ in between of words eg. new_team) is advised by new conventions

Reserved Keywords
You cannot have a variable name the same as a keyword
eg. False,None, True, and, or, not, break, continue, or, while etc.
